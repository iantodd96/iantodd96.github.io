	<h1> MY PORTFOLIO </h1>
	
	<p class="introduction">Welcome to my portfolio! I designed this webpage myself using HTML and CSS. You can save this website's data and view its code in an editor of your choice.
		Just be sure that when you're asked where and how it should be saved that you choose to save the complete webpage, not just the HTML file by itself.

		<summary id = "Proj1">Text Based Game Using Data Structures (Java)</summary>
		<p class="sumText">This was a final project for a university course. It makes the use of the linked list, graph, and deque data structures. The goal is to make it to the bottom of a cave
			while being chased by a monster. The player can use various types of items along the way to help them slow the monster down and deal with the intense heat deeper in the caves.
			Made using Java in Windows 10.

		<summary id = "Proj2">University Database Project (Java/SQL)</summary>
		<p class="sumText">This was a final project for a university course. Using SQL and Java together, the user can log into the database, having different permissions depending on what
			type of user they are. The project acted as a university's student and employee database, so, for example, students can only view their own information and enroll or drop courses while
			an administrator has full control over all aspects of the database. Made using Java and MySQL in Linux Mint.
